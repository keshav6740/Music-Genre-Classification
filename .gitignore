# TensorFlow/Keras SavedModel (if you ever save in that format locally)
# Adjust if your .keras model is large and you want to ensure it's tracked
# but exclude other large model save formats.
# For now, we WANT music_genre_classifier.keras to be tracked.

# Large dataset - typically not committed to Git if very large
# If your Data/ folder is huge (many GBs), consider if you really need it in the repo.
# For deployment, only the .keras model is needed.
# If it's manageable (e.g., < 100-200MB total repo size), it's fine.
